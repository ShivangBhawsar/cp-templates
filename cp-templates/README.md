# Intro:

- This is a repository that contains .cpp files for algos and ds that could be used in cp.
- One can [convert these cpp files to code snippets](https://snippet-generator.app/) and add them to your ide/ editor to quickly summon these while writing code.
- There is also a .vscode folder which you can pull locally in any directory in which you want to use these CP templates.

# Certain things to consider while contributing:

- Make sure all the variable and method names are as relevant as possible.
- Always write a .txt file as well while contributing any new algo and write a few comments there that might be relevant while either using or modifying the algo or if there is any special condition anywhere.
- Wherever sensible create structs and classes so that data structures could be resused also use C++ templates wherever possible, like in segtree, fenwick tree, etc.
- Keep all the relevant algo and ds in one namespace in one cpp file, like common math realted stuff. (For ex: power, modInverse, nCr, etc. in math namespace).
- Please refer already existing code in this repo to better understand what is preffered.
- Only commit any new change if it is well tested before preferrably on [Library Checker](https://judge.yosupo.jp/) or [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/).
- There are other already exisitng great libraries like [ac-library](https://github.com/atcoder/ac-library) and [code-library](https://github.com/ShahjalalShohag/code-library) and [Competitive-Coding](https://github.com/Ashishgup1/Competitive-Coding/) and [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl), but the aim of this project is for me and my friends to have everything that we completely understand and could use without thinking twice in a contest at one place.

Forget all this, just need working cpp code in this repo!
